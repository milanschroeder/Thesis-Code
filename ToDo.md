### ToDo list:

-   sort & clean code -\> clean replication data
-   tokenize full candidate names as compound expression
-   add plot layers with
    -   disinformation highlights
    -   individual article/mentions counts per newspaper
    -   aggregated article/mentions count
    -   sentiment scores!
-   word_frequencies (aggregated by day/week, what else?)
-   sentiment analyses (avg, binary for each doc, plot by c/d case)
    -   compare results across dictionaries
    -   plot/compare base sentiment to candidate sentiment over time (better use headlines here to compare across sources)
-   clean unnecessary stuff from 02_data_extraction_Factiva.R
-   build replication scraper that uses saved .txt files
-   improve scraping functions to make them publicly available
-   clean folders
